Good morning, I am Sumayya Beegam from Kerala. I have completed my master's in Computer Applications from Mar Athanasius College of Engineering, Kothamangalam. Currently, I am undergoing training at Cognizant, where I recently completed a project focusing on E-commerce automation for Flipkart using Selenium.In addition to my professional training, I have worked on two web applications as part of my academics. The first application utilizes deep learning to track users' calorie intake from the images they upload. The second one is a web application for predicting stock prices based on historical data using machine learning techniques.

My short-term goal is to attain a higher designation within the organization, while my long-term goal is to achieve financial independence. I consider myself adaptable and open to embracing change, which I believe is crucial in the dynamic field of technology.During my free time, I enjoy watching movies.
